PyMQI - Python interface to WebSphere MQ (MQSeries)
-------------------------------------------------------

PyMQI allows one to connect to queue managers to issue MQAI and PCF requests.

Consider the code below which establishes a connection, puts a message
on a queue and disconnects.

```python
    import pymqi
    
    queue_manager = 'QM01'
    channel = 'SVRCONN.1'
    host = '192.168.1.135'
    port = '1434'
    queue_name = 'TEST.1'
    message = 'Hello from Python!'
    conn_info = '%s(%s)' % (host, port)
    
    qmgr = pymqi.connect(queue_manager, channel, conn_info)
    
    queue = pymqi.Queue(qmgr, queue_name)
    queue.put(message)
    queue.close()
    
    qmgr.disconnect()
```

About this port
=====================
There are some tests fail to pass, while some tests may not be applicable to 
python3, there might be bugs caused by this porting. I'll look into those latter.
Patches for welcome.


Supported MQ versions
=====================

According to PyMQI, any MQ version between 5.0 and 7.5 should work.
Note this port will only work will Python 3.x.
